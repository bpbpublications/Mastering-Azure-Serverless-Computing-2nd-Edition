## About the Book
Mastering Azure Serverless Computing offers a modern approach to application development, enabling developers to build and deploy applications without managing infrastructure. This approach allows for faster development, greater scalability, and reduced operational costs.

This book is your guide to building agile and cost-effective cloud applications using Microsoft Azure's Serverless technologies. This updated edition expands core serverless concepts and services like Azure Functions, Azure Durable Functions, and Azure Logic Apps. New to this edition is comprehensive coverage of Azure Serverless Cosmos DB for globally distributed NoSQL applications and a dedicated exploration of containerized serverless deployments through Azure Serverless Kubernetes and the streamlined Azure Container Apps service. The book features completely revamped Azure Portal screenshots reflecting the latest interface. The concluding sections on designing and implementing serverless solutions have been significantly enhanced with detailed scenarios and a new, practical end-to-end implementation lab focused on a Customer Tweet Analysis application, solidifying your ability to architect real-world solutions. 

By the end of this book, you will be adept at leveraging the full spectrum of Azure Serverless Services. You will possess the practical skills to design, develop, and deploy highly scalable, cost-optimized, and innovative Serverless applications, equipped with the knowledge of the newest services and updated best practices in the Azure ecosystem.
